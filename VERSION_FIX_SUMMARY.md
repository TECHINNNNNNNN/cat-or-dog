# TensorFlow/Keras Version Compatibility Fix

## Problem
- **Local**: TensorFlow 2.19.0 + Keras 3.11.1 (Python 3.12)  
- **Cloud**: TensorFlow 2.15.0 + Keras 2.15 (Python 3.11)
- **Error**: `Unrecognized keyword arguments: ['batch_shape']`

The model was saved with Keras 3.x which uses `batch_shape` parameter, but cloud deployment was trying to load it with Keras 2.x which expects `batch_input_shape`.

## Root Cause
Starting with TensorFlow 2.16, Keras 3 became the default. Models saved with Keras 3 cannot be loaded by Keras 2 due to configuration parameter differences.

## Solution
Updated requirements to use **TensorFlow 2.16.2+** which:
1. ✅ Includes Keras 3 by default (compatible with our model)
2. ✅ Supports Python 3.11 (Streamlit Cloud compatibility)  
3. ✅ Can load models saved with TensorFlow 2.19.0/Keras 3.x
4. ✅ Available on PyPI for all platforms

## Changes Made
1. `requirements.txt`: `tensorflow-cpu==2.15.0` → `tensorflow-cpu>=2.16.2`
2. `requirements-cloud.txt`: `tensorflow-cpu==2.19.0` → `tensorflow-cpu>=2.16.2`

## Verification
- ✅ Model loads successfully locally with TF 2.19.0
- ✅ All model utilities (CatDogClassifier, ModelVisualizer) work correctly
- ✅ Streamlit app imports work without errors
- ✅ TensorFlow 2.16.2+ supports both Python 3.11 and 3.12

## Deployment
The fix should resolve the Streamlit Cloud deployment error. The app will now use TensorFlow 2.16.2+ with Keras 3, matching the format our model was saved in.
